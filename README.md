# joycpp
Joy Interpreter written in C++ and Joy

23/12/19
The most important thing to recognise about the Joy Programming Language (joylang) is that most of it can be written in Joy. 

The Joy interpeter [original](https://github.com/ifknot/joycpp_old)
 quick and dirty version got me interested in the Joy Programming Language and after some time spent with the writings of Manfred von Thun and others it is time do this beautiful language justice. Time for a better joycpp.

A joycpp where only the most essential parts are written in C++ and the remainder is written in Joy.

Original version repository renamed [joycpp_old](https://github.com/ifknot/joycpp_old) this is the new version.
